My first _completed-ish_ Python project. <br/><br/>
It requires the [terminaltables](https://pypi.org/project/terminaltables/) module to display the pretty game board. <br/><br/>
Things I'd still like to improve:
* GUI interface for the game
* Improve computer strategy (currently the computer selects a random space)
* Break code out into modules (constants, validator functions, gameplay functions)
* Refactor larger functions into smaller ones (gamePlay, getHuman/Computermove especially)
